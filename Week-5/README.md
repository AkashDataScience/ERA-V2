# Session 5 - Introduction to PyTorch
Convolution nueral network with fully connected layers implimentation using PyTorch.

## Overview
MNIST dataset is used for this project. It contains 60,000 images of digits from 0 to 9. We are
using convolution nueral network. The network contains 4 convolution layers and 2 fully connected
layers. ReLU is used as activation function.
