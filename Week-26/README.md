# Assignment
## Assignment 1
1. Take grid world environment from [UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)
2. Update the `valueIterationAgents.py` and `qlearningAgents.py`.
3. Make changes in gridworld environment if require. 
4. Run the gridworld environment and create video.

## Assignment 2
1. Create a new map of some other city for the code shared above
2. Add a DNN with 1 more FC layer.
3. Your map must have 3 targets A1>A2>A3 and your car/robot/object must target these alternatively.
4. Train your best model upload a video on YouTube and share the URL

# Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to use available enviroments like GridWorld and CarMap to train 
reinforcement learning agent. Customize given environment to train our agent.
